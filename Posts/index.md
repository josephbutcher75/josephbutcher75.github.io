This is a folder for cleaner layout. Title needs to match name of directory, this file must be called index.md within the folder, all other files must be unique_name.md and change the nav order depending on nav bar order, and has_children should be true if you have sub folders and false if not. You can use this to create anything, this example is posts such as "Weekly Auction Post", or "Hot Deals", or "Bophies Banger Deals".
