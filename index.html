      <h2>How the Online Auction Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> I connect with you to discuss your needs and timeline.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> We meet to assess the property, outline goals, and complete the auction agreement.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> My team and the Kaufman crew catalog, photograph, and prepare the items for sale.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Your auction is published and promoted to thousands of buyers online.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Bidders pay Kaufman directly through our secure checkout.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Buyers arrive on pickup day to collect their items â€” supervised by us.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Kaufman handles payment to you, usually within 14 days of auction close.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>From start to finish, we handle every detail â€” marketing, questions, payments, and pickup. All you have to do is say yes.</em></p>
