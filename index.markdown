### About Joe

Iâ€™m Joe Butcher â€” a professional auctioneer based in the heart of West Virginia. With a background in government service, deep family roots in this community, and a lifelong interest in fair dealing and hard work, I specialize in online-only auctions that bring big results without big hassle.

I handle personal property, farm equipment, heavy machinery, estate items, coins, antiques, and more. Partnering with Kaufman Realty & Auctions gives you national exposure and world-class service with a local handshake.
